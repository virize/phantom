<b>THE PROJECT:</b>  Made in collaboration with the Museum of Vancouver and Simon Fraser University's School of Interactive Arts + Technology (SIAT), the team interviewed local landscape architecture firm Hapa Collaborative, highlighting why they design as well as some of their various projects and installations within the city of Vancouver in a documentary style film.

<b>TEAM:</b> Jennifer Hiew, Phoebe Lim, Michelle Ng, Grant Zou

<b>ROLES:</b> Producer and back-end; ideation, storyboarding, scripting, filming, editing

<b>PROCESS:</b> The team was presented with two themes in which to work with to produce a documentary film: the theme of TRUST; and the theme of "WHY I DESIGN", an annual event hosted by the Museum of Vancouver showcasing the work of local designers and what motivates them to do the things they do. We contacted Hapa Collaborative, a Vancouver-based landscape architecture firm with a particular interest in creating both private works and public installations which address the leftover spaces between buildings, explore new methods and materials, and create memorable places for people to enjoy.

Hapa expressed great interest in working with our team and the Museum of Vancouver to create a film about their firm and "Why I Design". Before conducting the actual interviews, the team created a storyboard with myself developing the majority to give Hapa a clear idea and direction of how the team envisioned the film.
